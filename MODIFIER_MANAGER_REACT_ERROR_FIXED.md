# ModifierManager React State Update Error - FIXED

## Issue Summary

When clicking "Add Modifier" in the pizza form, the following React error occurred:

```
Cannot update a component (`CreatePizzaFormWithOptimisticUpdates`) while rendering a different component (`ModifierManager`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `ModifierManager`, follow the stack trace as described in https://react.dev/link/setstate-in-render
```

## Root Cause

The `ModifierManager` component was calling the `onModifiersChange` callback during the state update process inside `setState` callbacks. This violates React's rules because it causes state updates to happen during render, leading to the error.

## Files Fixed

- `/components/modifier-manager.tsx`

## Changes Made

### Before (Problematic Pattern):

```tsx
setLocalModifiers((prev) => {
  const updated = [...prev, tempModifier];
  onModifiersChange(updated); // ❌ Called during state update
  return updated;
});
```

### After (Fixed Pattern):

```tsx
const updated = [...localModifiers, tempModifier];
setLocalModifiers(updated);
onModifiersChange(updated); // ✅ Called after state update
```

## Functions Fixed

1. **handleAddModifier**: Fixed state update that was calling parent callback during render
2. **handleDeleteModifier**: Fixed state update that was calling parent callback during render
3. **handleDrop** (drag-and-drop reorder): Fixed state update that was calling parent callback during render

## Result

- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ No React state update errors
- ✅ Modifier functionality works correctly
- ✅ All CRUD operations (add, delete, reorder) work without errors

## Testing

The modifier management functionality now works correctly:

- Adding modifiers ✅
- Deleting modifiers ✅
- Reordering modifiers via drag-and-drop ✅
- Form state updates properly ✅

The error is completely resolved and the application is ready for production use.
