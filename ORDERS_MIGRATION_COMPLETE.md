# Orders Migration Completed ✅

## Summary

Successfully migrated the orders feature from using API routes and server-side rendering to client queries using TanStack Query (React Query) and Supabase client.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Client Service Created

- **File**: `/lib/supabase-queries/order-client-service.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles all order CRUD operations directly with Supabase client
- **Functions**:
  - `getOrders()` - Fetch orders with filters and pagination
  - `getOrderById()` - Fetch single order by ID
  - `createOrder()` - Create new order
  - `updateOrder()` - Update existing order
  - `deleteOrder()` - Delete order
  - `cancelOrder()` - Cancel order (moves to canceled_orders table)
  - `modifyOrder()` - Modify order (creates record in modified_orders table)
  - `getOrderHistory()` - Get order modification history
  - `getCanceledOrders()` - Get canceled orders
  - `getModifiedOrders()` - Get modified orders

### 2. Hooks Migration

- **File**: `/modules/orders-feature/hooks/use-orders.ts`
- **Changes**: All fetch calls replaced with client service calls
- **Features**: Maintains all existing functionality with improved caching and real-time updates

### 3. SSR Pages Updated

- **File**: `/app/admin/orders/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Updated to use client service for prefetching with QueryClient and HydrationBoundary

### 4. API Routes Removed

- **Deleted**: All `/app/api/orders/**` files
- **Impact**: No more server-side order API endpoints - all handled client-side

### 5. Component Updates

- **Files Updated**:
  - `/components/edit-order-dialog.tsx` - Uses client service for cancel/modify operations
  - `/hooks/use-order-receipt.ts` - Uses client service for order fetching
  - `/modules/cart/components/cart-panel.tsx` - Added conversion function for type compatibility
  - `/modules/orders-feature/components/orders-list.tsx` - Added type conversion for legacy component compatibility

### 6. Type System Alignment

The migration takes a pragmatic approach to type safety:

- **Client Service**: Uses existing `Order` types from `@/lib/orders/db-schema` for consistency with pizza/pie patterns
- **Database Types**: References `database.types.ts` for the source of truth about database schema
- **UI Conversion**: Minimal conversion at UI boundaries where legacy `ApiOrder` format is still expected
- **Future Direction**: The database types from `database.types.ts` serve as the foundation for future type migrations

This approach prioritizes:

1. **Immediate functionality** - Migration works without breaking existing code
2. **Type safety** - Uses generated types as the source of truth
3. **Gradual evolution** - Allows incremental migration to pure database types
4. **Consistency** - Follows established patterns from pizza/pie features

## Technical Benefits

1. **Performance**: Direct Supabase client queries are faster than API round trips
2. **Real-time**: Automatic cache invalidation and real-time updates with TanStack Query
3. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration with Supabase generated types, including proper CartItem → OrderItem conversion
4. **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as pizza/pie features
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized order logic in client service
6. **Data Integrity**: Automatic conversion ensures UI components receive properly structured data

## Migration Notes

- **Database Policies**: User needs to manually update Supabase RLS policies for orders, canceled_orders, and modified_orders tables
- **Type Evolution**: Uses database types (`database.types.ts`) as reference and performs minimal conversion only at UI boundaries where needed
- **Data Transformation**: Added `transformCartItemsToOrderItems()` function to ensure proper conversion from cart format to order format (CartItem → OrderItem)
- **Order Numbering**: Restored sequential order numbering (ORD-0001, ORD-0002, etc.) instead of timestamp-based format
- **Build Verification**: All TypeScript errors resolved and build passes successfully
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary type transformation layers in favor of direct database type usage
- **Runtime Fix**: Resolved "unitPrice is undefined" error by ensuring proper data structure conversion

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:

- `/lib/supabase-queries/order-client-service.ts`

### Modified:

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
