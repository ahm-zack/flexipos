# Create Form Toast Enhancement: Single Loading Toast

## Issue Description

In the create forms for pizza, pie, mini-pie, and sandwich items, users were seeing multiple toast notifications during the creation process:

1. **"Uploading image..."** toast (when image was selected)
2. **"[Item] created successfully!"** toast (when creation completed)

This created a cluttered notification experience with multiple toasts appearing sequentially.

## Solution Implemented

Implemented a single toast notification system that:

1. **Starts with loading state**: Shows spinner with "Creating [item]..." message
2. **Updates on completion**: Same toast transforms to show success or error
3. **Contextual descriptions**: Different descriptions based on whether image is being uploaded

## Files Updated

### 1. Pizza Create Form

**File**: `/modules/pizza-feature/components/create-pizza-form.tsx`

**Before:**

```typescript
// Upload image if file is selected
if (selectedFile) {
  toast.info("Uploading image...");
  // ... upload logic
}

await createPizzaMutation.mutateAsync(pizzaData);
toast.success("Pizza created successfully!");
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Show loading toast with spinner
const toastId = toast.loading("Creating pizza...", {
  description: selectedFile
    ? "Uploading image and saving pizza..."
    : "Saving pizza data...",
});

// ... upload and creation logic

toast.success("Pizza created successfully!", {
  id: toastId,
  description: "Your new pizza has been added to the menu",
});
```

### 2. Pie Create Form

**File**: `/modules/pie-feature/components/create-pie-form.tsx`

- Applied same pattern with "Creating pie..." message
- Dynamic descriptions based on image upload

### 3. Mini-Pie Create Form

**File**: `/modules/mini-pie-feature/components/create-mini-pie-form.tsx`

- Applied same pattern with "Creating mini pie..." message
- Dynamic descriptions based on image upload

### 4. Sandwich Create Form

**File**: `/modules/sandwich-feature/components/create-sandwich-form.tsx`

- Applied same pattern with "Creating sandwich..." message
- Dynamic descriptions based on image upload

## Key Features

### **Single Toast Experience**

- Uses `toast.loading()` to start with spinner animation
- Updates the same toast using `id: toastId` parameter
- No more multiple overlapping notifications

### **Contextual Messages**

- **With Image**: "Uploading image and saving [item]..."
- **Without Image**: "Saving [item] data..."
- **Success**: "[Item] created successfully!" with description
- **Error**: "Failed to create [item]" with helpful description

### **Error Handling**

- Upload failures now update the same toast with warning
- Creation failures update the same toast with error message
- Consistent error descriptions: "Please try again or contact support"

## User Experience Improvements

### **Before:**

```
üîµ Info: "Uploading image..."
‚úÖ Success: "Pizza created successfully!"
```

### **After:**

```
‚è≥ Loading: "Creating pizza..." (with spinner)
     ‚Üì (transforms to)
‚úÖ Success: "Pizza created successfully!"
```

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Start loading toast
const toastId = toast.loading("Creating [item]...", {
  description: "Dynamic description based on context",
});

try {
  // ... creation logic

  // Update to success
  toast.success("[Item] created successfully!", {
    id: toastId,
    description: "Your new [item] has been added to the menu",
  });
} catch (error) {
  // Update to error
  toast.error("Failed to create [item]", {
    id: toastId,
    description: "Please try again or contact support",
  });
}
```
