# Storage Buckets Implementation Complete âœ…

## Summary

The Supabase storage buckets for pie and pizza images have been successfully implemented and are working correctly.

## What Was Completed

### âœ… Storage Buckets Created

- **pie-images** bucket created and configured
- **pizza-images** bucket created and configured
- Both buckets are properly set up with public read access and authenticated upload policies

### âœ… Storage Policies Configured

**For both buckets (pie-images and pizza-images):**

- **Public Read Access**: Anyone can view/download images (`SELECT` for `public` role)
- **Authenticated Upload**: Authenticated users can upload images (`INSERT` for `authenticated` role)
- **Authenticated Update**: Authenticated users can update their images (`UPDATE` for `authenticated` role)
- **Authenticated Delete**: Authenticated users can delete their images (`DELETE` for `authenticated` role)

### âœ… Image Upload Utility Updated

- `/lib/image-upload.ts` properly configured to use new buckets
- Dynamic bucket selection based on category (pies â†’ pie-images, pizzas â†’ pizza-images)
- Automatic bucket creation if missing (for development)
- Proper error handling and logging

### âœ… Supabase Configuration

- `/supabase/config.toml` updated with bucket definitions
- `/supabase/migrations/005_create_storage_buckets.sql` migration created
- All migrations applied successfully

## Verification Results âœ…

### Database Check

```sql
SELECT name FROM storage.buckets;
```

Result: Both `pie-images` and `pizza-images` buckets exist

### Policy Check

8 policies correctly set up:

- 4 policies for pie-images bucket (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- 4 policies for pizza-images bucket (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### Application Build

- âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
- âœ… No lint errors
- âœ… All routes built successfully
- âœ… Build size optimized

### Functionality Test

- âœ… Buckets are accessible via Supabase client
- âœ… Service role can list all buckets
- âœ… Anonymous role can access individual buckets for uploads
- âœ… Image upload utility properly detects and uses correct buckets

## Usage

### For Pie Images

```typescript
import { uploadMenuImage } from "@/lib/image-upload";

const imageUrl = await uploadMenuImage(file, "pies");
// Will upload to 'pie-images' bucket
```

### For Pizza Images

```typescript
import { uploadMenuImage } from "@/lib/image-upload";

const imageUrl = await uploadMenuImage(file, "pizzas");
// Will upload to 'pizza-images' bucket
```

## Development Notes

1. **Local Development**: Buckets are automatically created if they don't exist
2. **Production**: Make sure to run the migration on production Supabase instance
3. **File Size Limit**: 5MB maximum per image
4. **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPEG, JPG, GIF, WebP
5. **Public Access**: All uploaded images are publicly accessible via URL

## Supabase Studio Access

The storage buckets can be viewed and managed at:

- **Local Development**: http://127.0.0.1:54323 (Storage section)
- **Production**: Your Supabase project dashboard

## Migration Status

All migrations have been applied:

- âœ… 001_create_users_table.sql
- âœ… 002_implement_rbac.sql
- âœ… 004_create_pies_table.sql (crust field removed, pie types updated)
- âœ… 005_create_storage_buckets.sql (new buckets and policies)

The storage bucket implementation is **COMPLETE** and ready for use! ðŸŽ‰
