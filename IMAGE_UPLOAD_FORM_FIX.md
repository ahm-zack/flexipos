# Image Upload Form Fix: Removed Extra Blue X Button

## Issue Description

In the edit forms for pizza, pie, and sandwich items, there was an extra blue X button appearing when users changed images. This created a confusing user experience with two X buttons:

1. **Blue X** - "Revert to original image"
2. **Red X** - "Remove image completely"

## Root Cause

The edit forms had dual functionality for image management:

- One button to revert to the original image (blue X)
- Another button to clear the image completely (red X)

However, this created UI confusion with two similar-looking X buttons that had different behaviors.

## Solution Implemented

### Files Fixed:

1. `/modules/pizza-feature/components/edit-pizza-form.tsx`
2. `/modules/pie-feature/components/edit-pie-form.tsx`
3. `/modules/sandwich-feature/components/edit-sandwich-form.tsx`
4. `/modules/sandwich-feature/components/edit-sandwich-form-new.tsx`

### Changes Made:

**Before:**

```tsx
<div className="absolute top-2 right-2 flex gap-2">
  {/* Remove new selection (revert to original) */}
  {selectedFile && (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={removeImage}
      className="p-1 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-full hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors z-10"
      title="Revert to original image"
    >
      <X className="h-4 w-4" />
    </button>
  )}

  {/* Clear image completely */}
  <button
    type="button"
    onClick={clearExistingImage}
    className="p-1 bg-red-500 text-white rounded-full hover:bg-red-600 transition-colors z-10"
    title="Remove image"
  >
    <X className="h-4 w-4" />
  </button>
</div>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<div className="absolute top-2 right-2">
  {/* Clear image completely */}
  <button
    type="button"
    onClick={clearExistingImage}
    className="p-1 bg-red-500 text-white rounded-full hover:bg-red-600 transition-colors z-10"
    title="Remove image"
  >
    <X className="h-4 w-4" />
  </button>
</div>
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Removed blue X button**: Eliminated the confusing "revert to original" functionality
2. **Kept red X button**: Maintained the clear "remove image" functionality
3. **Removed unused functions**: Cleaned up `removeImage` functions that were no longer needed
4. **Simplified UI**: Single, clear action for image removal

## Forms Not Affected:

- **Mini-pie edit form**: Already had only one X button, so no changes needed
- **Create forms**: Only have one X button for removing selected images (no original image to revert to)

## User Experience Improvements:

- ✅ **Clearer Intent**: Single X button with obvious "remove image" purpose
- ✅ **Reduced Confusion**: No more dual X buttons with different behaviors
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: All edit forms now have the same image removal pattern
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users can easily understand what clicking the X will do

## Testing:

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All forms now have clean, single X button for image removal
- ✅ No unused functions or dead code remaining

This fix provides a much cleaner and more intuitive user experience when managing images in edit forms.
