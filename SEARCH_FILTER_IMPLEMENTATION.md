# Search and Filter Implementation for Orders List

## Overview

Added comprehensive search and filter functionality to the Orders list with responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Features Implemented

### üîç Search Bar

- **Location**: Next to the "Orders" title
- **Functionality**: Search by order number (case-insensitive)
- **UI Elements**:
  - Search icon on the left
  - Clear button (X) on the right when there's text
  - Placeholder text: "Search by order number..."

### üè∑Ô∏è Filter Buttons (5 filters)

1. **Cash** - Filter by cash payment method (green icon)
2. **Card** - Filter by card payment method (blue icon)
3. **Mixed** - Filter by mixed payment method (purple icon)
4. **Modified** - Filter by modified status (yellow icon)
5. **Canceled** - Filter by canceled status (red icon)

### üì± Responsive Design

#### Desktop (lg and above)

- Search bar and filters on the same row
- All button text visible
- Maximum width for search bar (max-w-md)

#### Tablet (sm to lg)

- Search bar and filters stack vertically
- Button text hidden, only icons visible
- Filters wrap to multiple rows if needed

#### Mobile (below sm)

- Full vertical stacking
- Compact button sizes
- Touch-friendly spacing

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");
const [activeFilters, setActiveFilters] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

### Filter Logic

- **Mutually Exclusive**: Payment method filters (cash/card/mixed) are mutually exclusive
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Status filters (modified/canceled) are mutually exclusive
- **Combined**: Can combine payment method + status filters
- **Client-Side**: Filtering done client-side for real-time response

### Search Implementation

- Real-time search as user types
- Case-insensitive matching
- Searches order number field
- Clear button appears when text is entered

### Filter Button Behavior

- **Active State**: Solid background when filter is active
- **Inactive State**: Outline style when filter is inactive
- **Toggle Behavior**: Click to toggle on/off
- **Exclusive Groups**: Selecting a payment method deselects others in that group

## UI Components Used

### Layout

- **Flex Layout**: Responsive flex containers for different screen sizes
- **Grid**: Maintains existing responsive grid for order cards
- **Spacing**: Consistent gap-4 spacing throughout

### Components

- `Input` - Search bar with custom styling
- `Button` - Filter buttons with variant support
- `Badge` - Enhanced with yellow color for modified orders
- Icons from `lucide-react` for visual feedback

### Responsive Classes

```css
/* Search and filters container */
flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-4

/* Search bar */
relative flex-1 max-w-md

/* Filter buttons container */
flex flex-wrap gap-2

/* Button text responsive visibility */
hidden sm:inline
```

## Enhanced Features

### Stats Display

- Shows "X of Y orders" when filters are active
- Updates dynamically based on filtered results
- Maintains pagination information

### Empty States

1. **No Data**: When no orders exist at all
2. **No Matches**: When filters/search return no results
   - Includes "Clear filters" button
   - Descriptive messaging

### Filter Persistence

- Filters reset to page 1 when changed
- Search and filters work together
- Clear functionality resets all filters and search

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation

- Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- Enter key support for buttons
- Focus indicators on all controls

### Screen Reader Support

- Proper ARIA labels
- Descriptive button text
- Icon-only buttons have screen reader text

### Touch Targets

- Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile
- Proper spacing between interactive elements
- Touch-friendly button sizes

## Performance Considerations

### Client-Side Filtering

- **Pros**: Real-time response, no API calls for each filter
- **Cons**: Limited to current page data
- **Future Enhancement**: Move to server-side filtering for large datasets

### Debouncing

- Search updates immediately (no debouncing currently)
- **Future Enhancement**: Add 300ms debouncing for API search

## Usage Examples

### Filter Combinations

- **Cash + Modified**: Show only modified orders paid with cash
- **Card Only**: Show only card payments
- **Search + Filter**: Search "ORD-0001" + filter by "canceled"

### Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop**: Full horizontal layout with text labels
- **Tablet**: Vertical stacking, icon-only buttons
- **Mobile**: Compact vertical layout, optimized for touch

This implementation provides a powerful and intuitive way to search and filter orders while maintaining excellent responsive design across all device sizes.
